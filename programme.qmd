### üßë One one one sessions with ADS Experts

Participants will be matched with an appropriate expert from the ADS to discuss their specific needs and requirements for their organisation or research project. We recommend that each participant come to the training school with a specific requirement in mind, however, we can also help to provide support during the training sessions. These sessions will take place on the last two days of the training school.
